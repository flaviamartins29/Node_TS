Node.js body parsing middleware.

Parse incoming request bodies in a middleware before your handlers, available
under the `req.body` property.

**Note** As `req.body`'s shape is based on user-controlled input, all
properties and values in this object are untrusted and should be validated
before trusting. For example, `req.body.foo.toString()` may fail in multiple
ways, for example the `foo` property may not be there or may not be a string,
and `toString` may not be a function and instead a string or other user input.

_This does not handle multipart bodies_, due to their complex and typically
large nature. For multipart bodies, you may be interested in the following
modules:

  * [busboy](https://www.npmjs.org/package/busboy#readme) and
    [connect-busboy](https://www.npmjs.org/package/connect-busboy#readme)
  * [multiparty](https://www.npmjs.org/package/multiparty#readme) and
    [connect-multiparty](https://www.npmjs.org/package/connect-multiparty#readme)
  * [formidable](https://www.npmjs.org/package/formidable#readme)
  * [multer](https://www.npmjs.org/package/multer#readme)

This module provides the following parsers:

  * [JSON body parser](#bodyparserjsonoptions)
  * [Raw body parser](#bodyparserrawoptions)
  * [Text body parser](#bodyparsertextoptions)
  * [URL-encoded form body parser](#bodyparserurlencodedoptions)

Other body parsers you might be interested in:

- [body](https://www.npmjs.org/package/body#readme)
- [co-body](https://www.npmjs.org/package/co-body#readme)

## Installation

```sh
$ npm install body-parser
```

## API

<!-- eslint-disable no-unused-vars -->

```js
var bodyParser = require('body-parser')
```

The `bodyParser` object exposes various factories to create middlewares. All
middlewares will populate the `req.body` property with the parsed body when
the `Content-Type` request header matches the `type` option, or an empty
object (`{}`) if there was no body to parse, the `Content-Type` was not matched,
or an error occurred.

The various errors returned by this module are described in the
[errors section](#errors).

### bodyParser.json([options])

Returns middleware that only parses `json` and only looks at requests where
the `Content-Type` header matches the `type` option. This parser accepts any
Unicode encoding of the body and supports automatic inflation of `gzip` and
`deflate` encodings.

A new `body` object containing the parsed data is populated on the `request`
object after the middleware (i.e. `req.body`).

#### Options

The `json` function takes an optional `options` object that may contain any of
the following keys:

##### inflate

When set to `true`, then deflated (compressed) bodies will be inflated; when
`false`, deflated bodies are rejected. Defaults to `true`.

##### limit

Controls the maximum request body size. If this is a number, then the value
specifies the number of bytes; if it is a string, the value is passed to the
[bytes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bytes) library for parsing. Defaults
to `'100kb'`.

##### reviver

The `reviver` option is passed directly to `JSON.parse` as the second
argument. You can find more information on this argument
[in the MDN documentation about JSON.parse](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse#Example.3A_Using_the_reviver_parameter).

##### strict

When set to `true`, will only accept arrays and objects; when `false` will
accept anything `JSON.parse` accepts. Defaults to `true`.

##### type

The `type` option is used to determine what media type the middleware will
parse. This option can be a string, array of strings, or a function. If not a
function, `type` option is passed directly to the
[type-is](https://www.npmjs.org/package/type-is#readme) library and this can
be an extension name (like `json`), a mime type (like `application/json`), or
a mime type with a wildcard (like `*/*` or `*/json`). If a function, the `type`
option is called as `fn(req)` and the request is parsed if it returns a truthy
value. Defaults to `application/json`.

##### verify

The `verify` option, if supplied, is called as `verify(req, res, buf, encoding)`,
where `buf` is a `Buffer` of the raw request body and `encoding` is the
encoding of the request. The parsing can be aborted by throwing an error.

### bodyParser.raw([options])

Returns middleware that parses all bodies as a `Buffer` and only looks at
requests where the `Content-Type` header matches the `type` option. This
parser supports automatic inflation of `gzip` and `deflate` encodings.

A new `body` object containing the parsed data is populated on the `request`
object after the middleware (i.e. `req.body`). This will be a `Buffer` object
of the body.

#### Options

The `raw` function takes an optional `options` object that may contain any of
the following keys:

##### inflate

When set to `true`, then deflated (compressed) bodies will be inflated; when
`false`, deflated bodies are rejected. Defaults to `true`.

##### limit

Controls the maximum request body size. If this is a number, then the value
specifies the number of bytes; if it is a string, the value is passed to the
[bytes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bytes) library for parsing. Defaults
to `'100kb'`.

##### type

The `type` option is used to determine what media type the middleware will
parse. This option can be a string, array of strings, or a function.
If not a function, `type` option is passed directly to the
[type-is](https://www.npmjs.org/package/type-is#readme) library and this
can be an extension name (like `bin`), a mime type (like
`application/octet-stream`), or a mime type with a wildcard (like `*/*` or
`application/*`). If a function, the `type` option is called as `fn(req)`
and the request is parsed if it returns a truthy value. Defaults to
`application/octet-stream`.

##### verify

The `verify` option, if supplied, is called as `verify(req, res, buf, encoding)`,
where `buf` is a `Buffer` of the raw request body and `encoding` is the
encoding of the request. The parsing can be aborted by throwing an error.

### bodyParser.text([options])

Returns middleware that parses all bodies as a string and only looks at
requests where the `Content-Type` header matches the `type` option. This
parser supports automatic inflation of `gzip` and `deflate` encodings.

A new `body` string containing the parsed data is populated on the `request`
object after the middleware (i.e. `req.body`). This will be a string of the
body.

#### Options

The `text` function takes an optional `options` object that may contain any of
the following keys:

##### defaultCharset

Specify the default character set for the text content if the charset is not
specified in the `Content-Type` header of the request. Defaults to `utf-8`.

##### inflate

When set to `true`, then deflated (compressed) bodies will be inflated; when
`false`, deflated bodies are rejected. Defaults to `true`.

##### limit

Controls the maximum request body size. If this is a number, then the value
specifies the number of bytes; if it is a string, the value is passed to the
[bytes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bytes) library for parsing. Defaults
to `'100kb'`.

##### type

The `type` option is used to determine what media type the middleware will
parse. This option can be a string, array of strings, or a function. If not
a function, `type` option is passed directly to the
[type-is](https://www.npmjs.org/package/type-is#readme) library and this can
be an extension name (like `txt`), a mime type (like `text/plain`), or a mime
type with a wildcard (like `*/*` or `text/*`). If a function, the `type`
option is called as `fn(req)` and the request is parsed if it returns a
truthy value. Defaults to `text/plain`.

##### verify

The `verify` option, if supplied, is called as `verify(req, res, buf, encoding)`,
where `buf` is a `Buffer` of the raw re
